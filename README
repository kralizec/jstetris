This Tetris implementation is written in JavaScript, and is designed to run
in any non-IE browser (though only Safari and Firefox are tested at this
point).

All drawing is done with the <canvas> object.

Configurability will improve in the future, but for now simple usage
examples can be seen in index.html and konami.html (the latter uses George
Mandis's Konami-code JavaScript to launch Tetris).

This project is a work-in-progress, a list of TODO items is included in the
comment at the top of tetris.js.
